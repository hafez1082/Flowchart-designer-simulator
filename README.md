A flowchart is a type of diagrams that represents an algorithm or a process, showing the steps
as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This
diagrammatic representation can give a step-by-step solution to a given problem. Flowcharts are
used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process of a program in various fields.

Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting complex processes or programs. Like other
types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help the viewer understand a
process, and perhaps also find flaws, bottlenecks, and other less-obvious features within it. There
are many different types of flowcharts, and each type has its own repertoire of boxes and notational
conventions. The most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:
1- Processing step; usually called activity, and denoted as a rectangular box
2- Decision; usually denoted as a diamond.
3- Inputs and outputs; usually denoted as parallelograms.
